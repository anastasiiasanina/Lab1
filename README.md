Quadratic equation solver

## Description
This program gives an opportunity to solve quadratic equations in two modes: 
interactive and non-interactive. User can choose one of these modes when starting the program.
At the end user will get complete equation, number of roots and precise result. 

## Setup

#### 1. Have Node JS installed.

#### 2. Clone the repository with command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anastasiiasanina/Lab1.git
```
#### 3. Run the program:
```bash
node equationSolver.js
```

## Interactive mode
You should type I to choose interactive mode.
After that just enter three arguments one by one to solve the equation. 

## Non-nteractive mode
You should type N to choose non-interactive mode.
After that enter name of the text file, which format should be .txt.
In the file there must be three arguments separated by one space from each other.
